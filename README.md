# Reconfigurable Computing-Speed and Area Trade-offs in FPGA Design
 CEN 598: Lab 1 design of hardware circuit using verilog in FPGA
 Objectives:-
• Intel Quartus II Prime for synthesis and analysis
• QuestaSim for simulating digital circuits
• Design hardware circuits in RTL (e.g. Verilog, VHDL)
• Use a given Verilog testbench to verify that the design is functionally correct and meets the
requested interface specifications.
• Understand the pros and cons of different FPGA implementations (baseline, pipelined, and
shared-hardware) of an application circuit.
• Optimize both pipelined and shared-hardware designs.
